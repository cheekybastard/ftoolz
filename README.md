Collection of higher-order and utility functions built on top of `cytoolz`.

## Module overview
Ftoolz are split into few generic modules.

### adt package
Package that provides implementation for various Abstract Data Types (ADTs).

| ADT | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `MutIter(s0)` | mutable iterator that can be both consumed and appended to, optionally initialized with init state `s0` |

### functoolz package
Package that provides higher-order functions commonly associated with Functor, Applicative and Monad. 

Moreover, there are general package-level functions implemented in `__init__.py`.
 
| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `attempt(ex, f, args, kwargs)` | equivalent to `try_except` with `g = lambda _: None` |
| `chain(*fs)` | reversed function composition `chain(f, g) = g o f` |
| `silence(errors)` | decorator that silences (selected/all) errors raised by decorated function |
| `try_apply(f, args, kwargs)` | equivalent to `attempt` with `ex = Exception` |
| `try_except(ex, f, g, args, kwargs)` | `f(args, kwargs)` and on exception(s) `ex` fallback to `g(args, kwargs)` |

The package content is organized into modules by individual type class:
1. `iter.py` for class `Iterable`. **Warn** some functions might not be pure because input iterable is consumed.
1. `opt.py` for class `Optional` 
1. `seq.py` for class `Seq` (`Sequece`). Methods typically return `tuple` instances to preserve immutability.

#### Module function overview
| def / .py | iter | opt | seq |
|-----------|------|-----|-----|
|`apply`| x | x | x |
|`apply2`| - | x | - |
|`applyN`| - | + | - |
|`flatmap`| x | x | x |
|`flatten`| x | x | x |
|`fmap`| x | x | x |
|`fmap2`| x | x | x |
|`fmap3`| - | x | - |
|`fmapN`| - | + | - |
|`fproduct`| x | x | x |
|`generate`| x | - | x |
|`lift`| x | x | x |
|`product`| x | x | x |
|`unit`| x | * | x |
|`zip_map`| + | - | + |

* `x` - implemented, statically type checked
* `+` - implemented, possible runtime type errors
* `*` - not implemented, supported natively
* `-` - not implemented 

#### traverse package
Each module contains traversable-related functions for traversables `Iterable` and `Seq`. 
Individual modules are named and reserved for single functor that wraps elements of the traversable sequence.

List of currently implemented functions in modules (functors): 

| def / .py | opt |
|-----------|-----|
|`sequence_iter`| x |
|`sequence_seq`| x |
|`traverse_iter`| x |
|`traverse_iter`| x |

### unsafe package
Package `unsafe` is dedicated to all *impure* functions that are prone to or 
will directly use side-effects.

#### reflection
This module contains functions for class discovery, inspection and 
modifications.

### typing
Typing contains helpful type aliases and other type-related definitions.

## cytoolz
Cytoolz is a cython implementation of a python library supporting functional style called 
[toolz](https://toolz.readthedocs.io).

We highly recommend reading the API docs and using it in your project.

Ftoolz does not fork but rather extends cytoolz and provides typed stubs for it's API. 
Please note that the typed stubs do not cover all the functions from cytoolz. 

Also some valid cases might not be covered due to Python's restricted typing capabilities.

## Setup development environment
It is highly recommended to use virtual environment to develop and test `ftoolz`. For making things easy there are 
two make targets to setup `ftoolz`:
* `make setup-dev` which creates new virtual environment in `./venv`
* `make setup` that just installs dependencies for development

Of course one can use his/her own favourite tool to create and manage python venv.

To activate the prepared venv run:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
and for deactivation simply `deactivate`.

## Running checks and tests

### Type checking
Type checking is done using `mypy` (for configuration see `mypy.ini`) and can be executed by:
```bash
make type-check
```

### Code style checking
Ftoolz uses [Flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html) for enforcing PEP 8 and other code smells.
```bash
make flake8-check
``` 

### Linting
Linting is configured in `.pylintrc` and can be run via:
```bash
make lint
```

### Tests
Unit and doc tests with coverage can be run by
```bash
make tests
```

One can also run all checks and tests at once via
```bash
make release-check
```

*Note*: Make sure you run these commands in an activate venv or a container.

## Distribution
Project uses `setuptools` for distribution. Check settings in `setup.py`.
